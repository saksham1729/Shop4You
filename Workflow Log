‚úÖ Recommendation System Fixes
    Resolved Django error: Cannot create distinct fields once a slice has been taken
    Refactored query to apply .distinct() before slicing and added .order_by('id')
    Styled recommendation results with images, prices, and emojis in HTML format
‚úÖ Chatbot Frontend Integration
    Enabled rich HTML rendering in BotUI via { type: 'html' }
    Ensured <img> and <div> blocks display product visuals correctly
    Helped update JavaScript to use innerHTML safely for rendering dynamic HTML
